# Architecture Overview

CivicConnect follows a modular architecture:

- Frontend UI layer for user interaction
- AI logic layer for categorization and priority
- Data layer for complaint storage
- Visualization layer for dashboard and maps

The prototype simulates this architecture and can be extended using Firebase and Google Cloud services.
